# Firewall-game
A project that is based off an idea I had back in high school for a game.

Controls:
Press and hold either the left and right arrow keys (<- and -> respectively) to move your ship.
Press the space bar in order to fire projectiles.
Press the enter button to set off a "purging bomb", which eradicates every enemy on the screen.*

*:You need at least 10,000 points to activate the ability.

Currently, each enemy destroyed grants you 100 points. I may or may not change this value later on.


If an enemy gets passed you, it will hit the "firewall", damaging it. If each individual firewall is damaged enough, it will be destroyed, allowing enemies passage unheeded. If enough enemies get passed you, the game ends.

Things that still need to be implemented:

Losing condition - certain # of enemies get passed the defender, the game should end.

Menu screen - Should come with a "How to Play" button, (opens a new page within the game window), a "Play" button, and a "Quit" button.

-------Optional Implementations-------
Varied difficulty settings:
-increases/decreases the number of enemies spawned/frequency
-increase/decrease enemy velocity range
-number of firewalls / how many hits each firewall can withstand
-increase/decrease number of points gained by each enemy destroyed

Add mouse input:
-use the mouse to "aim" and "fire" projectiles. Will probably come with its own separate animation/sprites.

FPS mode:
Making a first-person version of the game. This will probably be last on my to-do list, as I want to make the 2d, top-down version of the game fully functioning first.
