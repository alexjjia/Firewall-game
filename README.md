# Firewall-game
A project that is based off an idea I had back in high school for a game.

Controls:
Press and hold either the left and right arrow keys (<- and -> respectively) to move your ship.
Press the space bar in order to fire projectiles.

If an enemy gets passed you, it will hit the "firewall", damaging it. If each individual firewall is damaged enough, it will be destroyed, allowing enemies passage unheeded. If enough enemies get passed you, the game ends.
